Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    
    >>> from Products.RhaptosContent.setuphandlers import *
    >>> type(setup_cache_managers)
    <type 'function'>
